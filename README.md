Music Lyrics Classifier
Introduction
This project involves the creation of a music lyrics classifier
using Machine Learning models. The aim is to categorize lyrics into
different music genres based on their lyrical content. Such a
classifier could have a variety of applications, such as helping to
understand the distinguishing features of different genres, or
assisting music platforms in automated categorization of music
content.
Dataset
The dataset for this project has been sourced from Kaggle, and can
be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/
levkharlashkin/music-classification/input. The dataset consists of
songs spanning various genres, with each song's lyrics stored in
textual form.
Implementation
The classifier is implemented in the Jupyter notebook named
Classifier.ipynb. The notebook includes data preprocessing,
exploratory data analysis, and model training and evaluation stages.
We have employed Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
classifiers to predict the music genre based on the lyrics.
To run the classifier, you need to open the Classifier.ipynb
notebook in Jupyter, and run the cells in sequence from the top.
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed:
·Python 3
·Jupyter
·Libraries including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and nltk
Usage
1. Download the repository and navigate to the folder via the
command line.
2. Launch Jupyter by typing jupyter notebook in your command line
and pressing enter.
3. Open the Classifier.ipynb notebook.
4. Ensure the dataset is available in the same directory as the
notebook, or modify the data loading cell to match your dataset
location.
5. Run the cells in the notebook from top to bottom.
Please note that some cells might take a while to execute,
especially the model training cells, due to the volume of data and
the complexity of the models.
Results
The results of the classifier can be found in the final sections of
the Jupyter notebook. We have evaluated the model performance using
various metrics including accuracy score, confusion matrix, and
classification report. For a detailed analysis of the results,
please refer to the notebook.
